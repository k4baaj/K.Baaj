Welcome to my GitHub account, and thank you for visiting.
Rarely will you find tools here.
I created this account out of curiosity, merely to keep my tools in a safe and secure place.
It's not reasonable for me to develop a tool, put effort into it, and then offer it here for free for people to take and claim as their own, only to see them reupload it with their own rights, that's just not acceptable ðŸ˜’ !
And since you've made it this far, truth be told, out of laziness, I haven't included links to my social media accounts.
So, search for me online and find me... and follow me!
